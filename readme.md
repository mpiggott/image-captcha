# Google Image Search Based-Captcha

Simple experiment of creating an image based captcha backed by a Google image search.  Not intended to be secure ;)

Worth noting that a system based on this would probably violate copyright laws, and while google does offer a 'rights' parameter results appear to be sparse or empty with the public domain search.
